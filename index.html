			<p>Java is a computer programming language which is mainly object-oriented. It was
designed in order to be as much independent from the execution platform as possible.
This language was originally developed by James Gosling and other engineers at Sun
Microsystems. They started the Java project from research conducted at the Stanford
University in 1991. </p>
